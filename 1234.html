        <p>Today we started with a brainstorming session in our groups about what we knew about heat and heat transfer. Then we learnt about heat transfer. Heat can be transferred in three ways:</p>
        <p>1. Radiation where the heat energy just moves through space</p>
        <p>2. Conduction where the heat energy is transferred through contact with another object</p>
        <p>3. Convection where the heat is transferred through the movement of heated fluid within a greater body of fluid.</p>
        <p>We then got an activity where we had to predict wether a piece of metal, or a piece of plastic was hotter given the condition of sitting around at room temperature. Material has no impact on temperature, so they were the same. The only difference would be the rate at which they heat up.</p>
