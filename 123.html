        <p>Today we started with the basics of heat. We learnt that heat and temperature both measure the thermal eenergy in the particles of an object, but in different ways. Temperature measures the average energy across all of the particles in an object, whereas heat measures the sum of all of the heat in an object. A good example is an iceberg vs a hot cup of coffee. The coffee has high temperature because each particle has lots of energy, but the heat is low because there are very few particles. An iceberg, on the other hand. Has very low temperature sinec each particle is low energy, but very high heat due to the sheer mass of the iceberg.</p>
