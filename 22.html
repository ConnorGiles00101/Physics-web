        <p>Today we learnt all about work. Work is the product of Force (in newtons) and change in distance (Δd) multiplied by the cosine of the angle between the direction of the force and the direction of the change in distance, therefore W = F x Δd x cosΘ. Work represents the change in energy of an object (ΔE), if work is positive the object gains energy, if work is negative the object loses energy, if it is zero then there is no change at all.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Some questions I have from today are "Why is work refered to as work and not ΔE? Many other quantities that change are referred to as Δsomething, so why not work?", and "Work is defined as N x Δd, but that implies that work can only occur over a distance. But, it is still possible for an object to gain or lose energy without moving (e.g. someone pushing hard on a wall), which would make work = 0 despite the change in energy. So am I incorrect or does Work not apply for all cases of ΔE?".</p>
        <p>One thing that intrigued me about work is the fact that in physics, amount of work done correlates to ΔE, which is similar to how in real life the amount of work done changes your energy. If you have no work (e.g. because you are a child) you have lots of energy, but as soon as you get a job (and do work) your soul gets sucked out of your skull and you become an indefinitely tired husk.</p>
