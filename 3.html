        <h1>WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED SO FAR</h1>
        <p>We have covered quite a lot throughout the energy unit, and I have yet to properly cover much of it. So, this post will be dedicated to documenting everything I know up until this point.</p>
        <p>To begin, what is energy? Well energy is the metaphorical juice that powers objects in the real world, and allows them to move around. Energy is measured in joules (J).</p>
        <p>Energy can either be stored, or transferred into an object in order to allow it to do things. Energy cannot be created or destroyed. While the total amount of energy in a system can change, the amount of energy in the greater universe is constant.</p>
        <p>We can calculate the energy in objects using many different formulas. 4 important ones we have learned are:</p>
        <p>The formulas for gravitational energy: Eg = mgh or Eg = √2gh, where g represents gravity (in meters per second squared), h represents height (in meters) and m represents mass (in kg)</p>
        <p>The formula for kinetic energy: 0.5 x mv²,where m is mass (in kilograms), and v represents velocity (in meters per second)</p>
        <p>And the formula for the total mechanical energy in a system, Emech = Eg + Ek*</p>
        <p>*it's important to note that in the real world, one would have to also account for energy lost to things such as heat (represented by something like Ediss).<p>
        <p>When measuring energy, another thing to look at is the change in energy, also known as work. In any and all circumstances, work is equal to energy.Work (also measured in joules) can be calculated. it's quite simple too, W = FΔd(cosθ), where F is the force applied (in newtons), Δd is the change in distance, and θ is the angle between the direction the force is applied in, and the direction the object moved in.</p>
