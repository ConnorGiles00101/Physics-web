        <p>I have grouped these two days together because they were both about the same topic: energy Basics. Three things I learned from today are that energy cannot be created or destroyed, energy can be transferred between objects, and how to create "LOL" diagrams that show the changes in energy within a system. We also learned that energy can be measured in joules (J), where J = kg x (m²/s²).</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Some questions I have from these two days is "What is work? What does it do?" and "How exactly does potential energy work?"</p>
        <p>One thing that intrigued me was the fact that energy is apparently "real" and not just an abstract construct created to help explain the behaviour of objects.</p>
