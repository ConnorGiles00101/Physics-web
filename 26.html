        <p>Over the course of these days we looked at graviational potential energy, and the conservation of energy. We then used that knowledge to answer various questions about rollercoasters. Gravitational potential energy is the amount of energy stored by the earth, for an object. One could imagine an "invisible spring" between an object and the earth that represents the energy. The more compressed the spring is,the less energy in the earth. Gravitational potential energy can be calculated using the equation</p>
        <p>Eg = mgh </p>
        <p> where m is the mass of the object in kilograms, g is the rate of acceleration of gravity in meters per second squared, and h is height in meters. In the examples we observed, gravity was converted directly into kinetic energy used by the objects to move. The equation for kinetic energy is as follows</p>
        <p>Ek = (mv²)/2</p> <p>which can then be turned into a formula for velocity:</p>
        <p>v² = √(2Ek)/m</p>
        <p>this gives us velocity of an object at any given height, in meters per second.</p>
