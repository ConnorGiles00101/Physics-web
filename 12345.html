        <p>Today we looked at caliometry and heat capacity. Heat capacity is an objects ability to resist temperature change, the higher the capacity, the harder to change the temperature. We obsered this by placing various quantities of ice, granite, copper, and lead, into varying quantities of water. Whilst adjusting the temperatures of both elements. We observed that the change in heat capacity was dependant on the material, and it's mass. The higher the mass, the harder it is to change the temperature. This is due to the fact that an object with higher mass requrires more energy to ensure all of the particles lower to the same tmemperature. The more mass the more energy.</p></html>
